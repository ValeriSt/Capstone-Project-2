# Travel Stories Web Project

Welcome to the Travel Stories web project repository! This project is a platform where people can share their travel experiences through written stories. It's designed to be a hub for travel enthusiasts to connect, inspire, and be inspired by each other's adventures.

# Features:
Story Sharing: Users can share their travel experiences by writing storie.  
Story Rating: Users can rate other people stories with a 1-5 star rating system.  
Interactive Interface: Enjoy a visually appealing and user-friendly interface to explore travel stories.

# Technologies Used:
EJS  
CSS

ExpressJS  

# No Database:
This project is currently developed without a backend database. Stories are not stored persistently, and the project relies solely on client-side technologies. In future iterations, I plan to integrate a database to enable data persistence and user authentication.

# Compatibility:
At the moment, the project is optimized for PC viewing. While it may not display perfectly on mobile devices, we are actively working on making it responsive and mobile-friendly in future updates.
